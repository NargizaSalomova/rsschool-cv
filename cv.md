## *About me*
Having once started my journey in IT with self-study of the Python programming language, this hobby took a special place in my heart. But coding in Python, I lacked beautiful visualization of projects, which contributed to the transition to studying front-end development. At the moment, several layouts have been created, and with each project I try to improve my code, make it accessible, semantic and easy to read. I can search and analyze information, I know how to plan my time. 

I am confident that my dedication and punctuality will help me achieve success in the field of front-end development.
